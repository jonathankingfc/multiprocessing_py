Peddler: ♪ Oh I come from a land, from a faraway place, where the caravan camels roam. ♪
Man: ♪ Where it's flat and immense, and the heat is intense. ♪
Peddler: ♪ It's barbaric, but hey, it's home. When the wind's from the east, and the sun's from the west, and the sand in the glass is right. Come on down, stop on by, hop a carpet and fly, to another Arabian night. Arabian nights, like Arabian days. More often than not, are hotter than hot in a lot of good ways.

Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. Please, please, come closer. Too close. A little too close. There. Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this side of the river Jordan, on sale today. Come on down. Look at this. Yes. Combination hookah and coffeemaker. Also make juliene fries. Will not break. Will not... It broke. Ohh! Look at this. I have never seen one of these intact before. This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen. Ah, still good. Wait. Don't go. I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare. I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this. Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance. Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts. This is no ordinary lamp. It once changed the course of a young man's life. A young man who, like this lamp, was more than what he seemed. The diamond in the rough. Perhaps you would like to hear the tale? It begins on a dark night, where a dark man waits with a dark purpose.

Jafar: You are late.
Gazeem: A thousand apologies, O Patient One.
Jafar: You have it then?
Gazeem: I had to slit a few throats, but I got it. Ah-ah-ahhh. The treasure. Ow!
Jafar: Trust me, my pungent friend. You'll get what's coming to you.
Iago: What's coming to you. Awk!
Jafar: Quickly! Follow the trial. Faster.

Jafar: At last, after all my years of searching, the Cave of Wonders.
Iago: Awk. Cave of Wonders.
Gazeem: By Allah.
Jafar: Now, remember. Bring me the lamp. The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine. [chuckles]
Iago: Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp. Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?
Jafar: Shh.
Cave: [echoing rumble] Who disturbs my slumber?
Gazeem: [thief gasps] It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.
Cave: Know this. Only one may enter here, one whose worth lies within. A diamond in the rough.
Jafar: What are you waiting for? Go on.
[beast sighing]
[roaring]
[screaming]
Jafar: No!
Cave: Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.
Iago: [coughing] I can't believe it. I just don't believe it. We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp. Just forget it. Look at this. Look at this. I'm so tickled off that I'm molting.
Jafar: Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.
Iago: Oh, there's a big surprise. That's an incredible. I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from that surprise. What are we gonna do? We got a big problem here, a big...
Jafar: Yes. Only one may enter. I must find this one, this... diamond in the rough.
Razoul: Stop! Theif! I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat.

Razoul: You two, over that way, and you, follow me. We'll find fim.
Aladdin: Morning, ladies.
Woman: Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?
Aladdin: Trouble? No way. You're only in trouble if you get caught.
Razoul: Gotcha.
Aladdin: I'm in trouble.

Prince Achmed: Out of my way, you filthy brats.
Aladdin: Hey! If I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners.
Prince Achmed: Oh. I'll teach you some manners.
[men laugh]
[grimacing]
Aladdin: Look at that, Abu. It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends.
Crowd: Ooh!
Prince Achmed: Ha! You are a worthless street rat. You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you.
Aladdin: I'm not worthless. And I don't have fleas. [sighs] Come on, Abu. Let's go home. ♪ Riffraff, street rat. I don't buy that. If only they'd look closer. Would they see a poor boy? No siree.

[roosters crowing]
Prince Achmed: I've never been so insulted.
Sultan: Oh, Prince Achmed. You're not leaving so soon, are you?
Prince Achmed: Good luck marrying her off.
Sultan: Oh! Jasmine. Jasmine! Jasmine! Jasmine!
[snarling]
Sultan: Confound it, Rajah. So, this is why Prince Achmed stormed out.
Jasmine: Oh, Father. Rajah was just playing with him. Weren't you, Rajah? You were just playing with that overdressed, self-absored Prince Achmed, weren't you?
[both laughing]
[clears throat]
Sultan: Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every sutior who comes to call. The law says...
Both: You must be married to a prince...
Sultan: By your next birthday.
Jasmine: The law is wrong.
Sultan: You've only got three more days.
Jasmine: Father, I hate being forced into this. If I do marry, I want it to be for love.
Sultan: Jasmine... it's not only this law. I'm not going to be around forever, and, well, I... I just want to make sure you're taken care of. Provided for.
Jasmine: Please try to understand. I've never done a thing on my own. I've never had any real friends.
[grumbles]
Jasmie: Except you, Rajah. I've never even been outside the palace walls.
Sultan: But, Jasmine, you're a princess.
Jasmine: Then maybe I don't want to be a princess anymore.
Sultan: Oooh! I... I... Allah forbid you should have any daughters.
Rajah: Hmm?
Sultan: I don't know where she gets it from. Her mother wasn't so picky. Oh! Ah, Jafar. My most trusted advisor. I am in desperate need of your wisdom.
Jafar: My life is but to serve to you, my lord.
Sultan: It's the suitor business. Jasmine refuses to choose a husband. I'm at my wit's end.
Iago: Awk! Wit's end!
Sultan: [laughing] Oh! Have a cracker, pretty Polly.
Jafar: [Jafar laughs] Your Majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.
[grumbles]
Jafar: Now, then, perhaps I can divine a solution to this thorny problem.
Sultan: If anyone can help, it's you.
Jafar: But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond.
Sultan: Oh. Uh, my ring? But it's been in the family for years.
Jafar: It is necessary to find the princess a suitor. Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
Sultan: Everything will be... fine.
Jafar: The diamond.
Sultan: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine.
Jafar: You are most gracious, my liege. Now, run along and play with your little toys, hmm?
Sultan: Yes. That will be pretty good.
Iago: [spits, coughs] I can't take it anymore! If I gotta choke down on one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers... Bam! Whack!
Jafar: Calm yourself, Iago.
Iago: Then I'd grab him around the head. Whack!
Jafar: Soon I will be sultan, not that addle-pated twit.
Iago: And then I stuff the crackers down his throat. Ha, ha!
[whining]
Jasmine: Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah. But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me. I'll miss you.
[whimpers]
Jasmine: Goodbye.
[vendors calling out]
Aladdin: Okay, Abu. Go.
Man: Try this. Your taste buds will dance and sing.
[squeaking]
Man: Get your paws off that.
[taunting]
Man: Why, you... Get away from here, you cursed, filthy ape!
Abu: Goodbye.
Aladdin: Nice going, Abu.
[cooing]
Aladdin: Breakfast is served.
Man: Pretty lady, buy a pot. No finer pot in brass of silver. Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs. Sugar dates and pistachios. Would the lady like a necklace? A pretty necklace for a pretty lady. Fresh fish! We catch 'em, you buy 'em!
Jasmine: Oh, no. I don't think so. Oh!
[gulping]
Jasmine: Excuse me.
[gulps]
[belches]
Jasmine: I'm really very sorry.
Aladdin: Wow.
Abu: Uh-oh. Hello? Hello?
Jasmine: Oh, you must be hungry. Here you go.
Man: You'd better be able to pay for that.
Jasmine: Pay?
Man: No one steals from my cart.
Jasmine: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any money.
Man: Thief!
Jasmine: Please... If you let me go to the palace, I can get some from the Sultan.
Man: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?
Jasmine: No! No, please!
Aladdin: Thank you, kind sir. I'm so glad you found her. I've been looking all over for you.
Jasmine: What are you doing?
Aladdin: Just play along.
Man: You, uh, know this girl?
Aladdin: Sadly, yes. She is my sister. She's a little crazy.
Man: She said she knew the Sultan.
Aladdin: She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
Jasmine: O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?
[gibberish]
Aladdin: Tragic, isn't it? But no harm done. Now, come along, sis. Time to go see the doctor.
Jasmine: Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you?
Aladdin: No, no, no. Not that one. Come on, Sultan.
[gibbering, gasping]
Man: Huh? What? Come back here, you little thieves!
[explosion]
Iago: With all due respect, Your Rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
Jafar: Save your breath, Iago. Faster.
Iago: Yes, O mighty Evil One. [panting]
Jafar: Part, sands of time. Reveal to me the one who can enter the cave. Yes! Yes! There he is. My diamond in the rough.
Iago: That's him? That's the clown we've been waitin' for?
Jafar: Let's have the guards extend him an inviation to the palace, shall we?
Iago: Swell. [coughs]
[sinister laughter]
Aladdin: Almost there.
Jasmine: I want to thank you for stopping that man.
Aladdin: Uh, forget it. So, this is your first time in the marketplace, huh?
Jasmine: Is it that obvious?
Aladdin: Well, you do kind of stand out. I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous Agrabah can be.
Jasmine: Hmm. I'm a fast learner.
Abu: Wow.
Aladdin: [chuckling] Hey. Come on. This way. Whoa. Watch your head there. Be careful.
Jasmine: Is this where you live?
Aladdin: Yep. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.
Jasmine: That sounds fabulous.
Aladdin: Well, it's not much, but it's got a great view. Wow. The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
Jasmine: Oh, it's wonderful.
Aladdin: I wonder what it would be like to live here, and have servants and valets.
Jasmine: Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.
Aladdin: It's better than here. You're always scraping for food and ducking the guards.
Jasmine: You're not free to make your own choices.
Aladdin: Sometimes you feel so...
Jasmine: You're just...
Both: ...trapped.
Aladdin: [clears throat] So, where are you from?
Jasmine: What does it matter? I ran away and I am not going back.
Aladdin: Really? How come?
Abu: Why, you...
Jasmine: My father's forcing me to get married.
Aladdin: That's... that's awful. Abu!
[angry squeaking]
Jasmine: What?
Aladdin: Abu says, uh... that's not fair.
Abu: What?
Jasmine: Oh, did he?
Aladdin: Yeah, of course.
Jasmine: And does Abu have anything else to say?
Aladdin: Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help.
Abu: Oh, boy.
Jasmine: Hmm. Tell him that's very sweet.
Razoul: Here you are.
Both: They're after me! You?
Jasmine: My father must have sent them...
Aladdin: Do you trust me?
Jasmine: What?
Aladdin: Do you trust me?
Jasmine: Yes...
Aladdin: Then jump!
Razoul: We just keep running to each other, don't we, street rat?
Aladdin: Run! Go! Get out of here!
Razoul: Get this thing off of me! It's the dungeon for you, boy.
Aladdin: Get off me.
Jasmine: Let him go.
Razoul: Looky here, men. A street mouse.
[guards laugh]
Jasmine: Unhand him, by order of the princess.
Razoul: Princess Jasmine.
Aladdin: The princess?
Abu: Princess?
Razoul: What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat.
Jasmine: That's not your concern. Do as I command. Release him.
Razoul: I would, Princess, except my orders come from Jafar. You'll have to take it up with him.
Jasmine: Believe me, I will. Jafar?
Jafar: Oh, Princess.
Iago: Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.
Jafar: How may I be of service to you?
Jasmine: The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.
Jafar: Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. The boy was a crinimal.
Jasmine: What was his crime?
Iago: I can't breathe, Jafar.
Jafar: Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.
Iago: If you could just... Aah! That hurt!
Jasmine: He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.
Jafar: Oh, dear. Oh, how frightfully upsetting. Had but I known...
Jasmine: What do you mean?
Jafar: Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.
Jasmine: What sentence?
Jafar: Death.
[gasping]
Jafar: By beheading.
Jasmine: No.
Jafar: I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.
Jasmine: How could you? [weeping]
Iago: [coughing] [coughing, gasping] So, how did it go?
Jafar: I think she took it, rather well.
Jasmine: [Jasmine crying] It's all my fault, Rajah. I didn't even know his name.
[Rajah murmuring]
Aladdin: She was the princess. I can't believe it. I must have sounded stupid to her.
Abu: Yoo-hoo! Aladdin! Hello!
Aladdin: Abu. Down here.
[squeaking]
Aladdin: Come on, help me out of these.
[scolding]
Aladdin: Hey, she was in trouble. Ah, she was worth it.
Abu: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Aladdin: Don't worry. I'll never see her again. I'm a street rat, remember? And there's a law. She's gotta marry a prince. She deserves a prince.
Abu: Ta-da!
Aladdin: I'm a fool.
Old Man Jafar: You're only a fool if you give up, boy.
Aladdin: Who are you?
Old Man Jafar: A lowly prisoner, like yourself. But together, perhaps we can be more.
Aladdin: I'm listening.
Old Man Jafar: There is a cave, boy, a Cave of Wonders, fillled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
Abu: Ooh!
Old Man Jafar: Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager.
Iago: Jafar, can you hurry up? I'm dyin' in here. [squawking]
Aladdin: But the law says that only a prince can...
Old Man Jafar: You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you? Whoever has the gold makes the rules. [wheezing laugh]
Aladdin: So. Why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?
Old Man Jafar: I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it.
Aladdin: Uh, one problem. It's out there. We're in here.
Old Man Jafar: Uh-uh. Things aren't always what they seem. So, do we have a deal?
Abu: Oh, I don't know.
[thunder crashing]
Cave: Who disturbs my slumber?
Aladdin: Uh, it is I, Aladdin.
Cave: Proceed. Touch nothing but the lamp.
Old Man Jafar: Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp, and the you shall have your reward.
Aladdin: Come on, Abu.
[squeaking]
Aladdin: Would you look at that!
[whimpering]
Aladdin: Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer than the Sultan. Abu!
[whines]
Aladdin: Don't... touch... anything. We gotta find that lamp.
Abu: [grumbles] Huh? Aladdin!
Aladdin: Abu, will you knock it off?
[screeches]
Aladdin: Abu, what are you, crazy? A magic carpet. Come on. Come on out. We're not gonna hurt you.
[screeches]
Aladdin: Hey, take it easy, Abu. He's not gonna bite. Thanks.
[squeaking]
Aladdin: Hey. Wait a minute. Don't go. Maybe you can help us. Hey! Whoa! You see, we're trying to find this lamp. I think he knows where it is.
[squeaks excitedly]
[echoes]
Aladdin: [whispers] Wait here.
Abu: [moaning] Oh!
Aladdin: This is it. This is what we came all the way down here to... Abu! No!
Cave: Infidels!
Abu: Uh-oh.
Cave: You have touched the forbidden treasure! Now you will never again see the light of day!
Aladdin: Whoa!
Abu: Help! Help! Help!
Aladdin: Gotcha! Whoa. Carpet, let's move. Abu! Abu, this is no time to panic. Start panicking.
Both: Whoa!
[Abu panting]
[thunder cracks]
[roaring]
Aladdin: Help me out.
Old Man Jafar: Throw me the lamp.
Aladdin: I can't hold on. Give me your hand.
Old Man Jafar: First give me the lamp. [maniacal laughter] Yes! At last! [wicked laughter]
Aladdin: [Aladdin struggles] What are you doing?
Old Man Jafar: Giving you your reward. Your eternal reward. [screaming]
[yelling]
[roaring]
Old Man Jafar: [chuckling] It's mine.
Jafar: It's all mine. I... where is it? No. No!
Sultan: Jasmine? Oh, dearest. What's wrong?
Jasmine: [sniffling] Jafar has... done something terrible.
Sultan: There, there, my dear. We'll set it right. Now, tell me everything.
Abu: Oh. Aladdin. Wake up. Aladdin.
Aladdin: Oh! My head. We're trapped. That two-faced son of a jackal! [snarling] Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.
Abu: Aha!
Aladdin: [chuckling] Why, you hairy little thief. Looks like such a beat-up, worthless piece of junk. Hey, I think there's something written here, but it's hard to make out.
Genie: Aaaaahhhhh! Oy! 10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck. Hang on a second. Whoa! Whoa! Does it feel good to be outta there. Nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen. Hi. Where you from? What's your name?
Aladdin: Uh... Uh, Aladdin.
Genie: Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can we call you "Al"? Or maybe just "Din." How about "Laddie"? Sounds like, "Here, boy. C'mon, Laddie."
Aladdin: I must have hit my head harder than I thought.
Genie: Do you smoke? Mind if I do? [giggling] Oh, sorry, Cheetah. Hope I didn't singe the fur. Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you in a few millennia. Give me some tass-el. Yeah. Yo, yo. Say, you're a lot smaller than my last master. Either that or I'm gettin' bigger. Look from the side. Do I look different to you?
Aladdin: Wait a minute. I'm your master?
Genie: That's right. He can be taught. What would you wish for me? The ever impressive, the long contained, often imitated, but never duplicated... [echoing] Duplicated, duplicated... Genie... of the Lamp! Right here direct from the lamp, right here for your very much wish fulfillment. Thank you.
Aladdin: Whoa. Wish fulfillment?
Genie: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-nay on the wishing for more wishes. That's it. Three. Uno, dos, tres. No subsitutions, exchanges or refunds.
Aladdin: Now I know I'm dreaming.

Aladdin: You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want, right?
Genie: Ah, almost. There are a few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos.
Aladdin: Like?
Genie: Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody. So don't ask. Rule number two. I can't make anybody fall in love with anybody else. You little punim there. Rule number three. I can't bring people back from the dead. It's not a pretty picture. I don't like doing it. Other than that, you got it.
Aladdin: Hmm.
Abu: Oh!
Aladdin: Provisos? You mean limitations? On wishes? Some all-powerful genie. Can't even bring people back from the dead. I don't know, Abu. He probably can't even get us out of this cave. Looks like we're gonna have to find a way out.
Genie: Excuse me? Are you lookin' at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up? Did you bring me here? And all of a sudden, you're walking out on me? I don't think so, not right now. You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down!
[Abu screeches]
Genie: In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, anywhere. Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet. We're... outta here!
Sultan: Jafar, this is an outrage. If it weren't for all your years of loyal service... From now on, you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me, before they are beheaded.
Jafar: I assure you, Your Highness, it won't happen again.
Sultan: Jasmine... Jafar. Now, let's put this whole messy businese behind us. Please.
Jafar: My most abject and humblest apologies to you as well, Princess.
Jasmine: At least some good will come of my being forced to marry. When I am a queen, I will have the power to get rid of you.
[chuckles nervously]
Sultan: That's nice. All settled, then. Now, Jasmine, getting back to this suitor business... Jasmine? Jasmine!
Jafar: [growls] If only I had gotten that lamp.
Iago: "I will have the power to get rid of you." [growling] To think we gotta keep kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter for the rest of our lives...
Jafar: No, Iago. Only until she finds a chump husband. Then she'll have us banished. Or beheaded.
Both: Eww!
Iago: Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar. What if you were the chump husband?
Jafar: What?
Iago: Okay, you marry the princess, all right? And, uh, then you become the sultan.
Jafar: Oh. Marry the shrew. I become the sultan. The idea has merit.
Iago: Yes, merit. Yes. And then we drop papa-in-law and the little woman off a cliff. Yaaah! Kersplat!
Jafar: [wicked laughter] I love the way your foul little mind works.

Aladdin: Oh, you sure showed me. Now, about my three wishes.
Genie: Dost mine ears decieve me? Three? You are down by one, boy.
Aladdin: Ah, no. I never actually wished to get out of the cave. You did that on your own.
Genie: Well, I feel sheepish. All right, you baaad boy, but no more freebies.
Aladdin: Fair deal. So, three wishes. I want them to be good. What would you wish for?
Genie: Me? No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.
Aladdin: What?
Genie: No, I can't. I...
Aladdin: Come in. Tell me.
Genie: Freedom.
Aladdin: You're a prisoner?
Genie: It's all part and parcel of the whole genie gig. Phenomenal cosmic powers... Itty bitty living space.
Aladdin: Genie, that's terrible.
Genie: But, oh, to be free. Not have to go, "Poof. What do you need? Poof. What do you need? Poof. What do you need?" To be my own master. Such a thing would be grater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world. But what am I talking about? Let's get real here. It's not gonna happen. Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.
Aladdin: Why not?
Genie: The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out. So you can guess how often that's happened.
Aladdin: I'll do it. I'll set you free.
Genie: Uh-huh, yeah, right.
Aladdin: No, really, I promise. After I make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free.
Genie: Well, here's hopin'. All right. Let's make some magic. So how 'bout it? What is it you want most?
Aladdin: Well, there's this girl.
Genie: Wrong. I can't make anybody fall in love, remember?
Aladdin: Oh, but, Genie, she's smart and fun and...
Genie: Pretty?
Aladdin: Beautiful. She's got these eyes that just, and this hair. Wow. And her smile... [sighs] Ami.
Genie: C'est l'amour.
Aladdin: But she's the princess. To even have a chance, I'd have to be... Hey, can you make me a prince?
Genie: Let's see here. Chicken à la king? Nope. Alaskan king crab. Ow. I hate it when they do that. Caesar salad. Ah! Et tu, Brute? No. Aha. "To make a prince." Is that an official wish? Say the magic words.
Aladdin: Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince.
Genie: All right! Yo, yo! Woof! Woof! First, that fez-and-vest combo is much too third century. These patches. What are we trying to say, beggar? No. Let's work with me here. Ooh. I like it. Muy macho. Now, it still needs something. What does it say to me? It says mode of transportation. Excuse me, monkey boy. Aqui. Over here.
Abu: Uh-oh.
Genie: Here he comes. What better way to make your enterance on the streets of Agrabah then riding your very own brand-new camel. Watch out. They spit. Mmm. Not enough. Still not enough. Let's see. What do you need? What do you need? Yes! Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo. Whoa!

Genie: Talk about your trunk space. Check this action out.
[trumpets]

Prince Ali: Abu, you look good.
Genie: He's got the outfit. He's got the elephant. But we're not through yet. Hang on to your turban, kid. We're gonna make you a star.

Jafar: Sire, I've found a solution to the problem with your daughter.
Iago: Awk. The problem with your daughter.
Sultan: Oh, really?
Jafar: Right here. "If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, then the sultan shall choose for her."
Sultan: But Jasmine hated all those suitors. How could I choose someone she hates?
Jafar: Not to worry, my liege. There is more. "If in the event a suitable prince cannot be found,"
Sultan: Jerk.
Jafar: "a princess must then be wed to..." Hmm. Interesting.
Sultan: What? Who?
Jafar: The royal vizier. Why, that would be... me.
Sultan: But I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess. I'm quite sure that...
Jafar: Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.
Sultan: Yes. Desperate measures.
Jafar: You will order the princess to marry me.
Sultan: I will order... the princess... to... But you're so old.
Jafar: The princess will mary me.
Sultan: The princess will marry...
[trumpet fanfare]
Sultan: What? What is that? That music. [chuckling] Jafar, you must come and see this.

Sultan: [clapping] Splendid. Absolutely marvelous.
Prince Ali: [clears throat] Your Majesty, I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand.
Sultan: Prince Ali Ababwa. Of course. I'm delighted to meet you. This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He's delighted, too.
Jafar: Ecstatic. I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo...
Prince Ali: Ababwa.
Jafar: Whatever. You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to...
Sultan: By Allah, this is quite a remarkable device. Ooh. I don't suppose I might...
Prince Ali: Why, certainly, Your Majesty. Allow me.
Jafar: Sire, I must advise against this.
Sultan: Oh, button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun.
Iago: Ow, ow, ow.
Sultan: Ahh! Whoa! Look out! Here I come!
Jafar: Just where did you say you were from?
Prince Ali: Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure.
Jafar: Try me.
Sultan: Look out, Polly.
Iago: Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug. Aah! Whew!
Sultan: Out of the way. I'm coming in to land. Jafar, watch this.
Jafar: Spectacular, Your Highness.
Sultan: That was lovely. Yes, I do see to have a knack for it. This is a very impressive youth. And a prince besides. [whispers] If we're lucky, you won't have to marry Jasmine after all.
Jafar: I don't trust him, Sire.
Sultan: Nonsense. One thing, I pride myself on, Jafar, I'm an excellent judge of character.
Iago: Oh, excellent judge. Yeah, sure. Not!
Sultan: Jasmine will like this one.
Prince Ali: And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine.
Jafar: Your Highness, no. I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf. This boy is no different from the others. What makes him think he is worthy of the princess?
Prince Ali: Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa. Just let her meet me. I will win your daughter.
Jasmine: How dare you. All of you. Standing around deciding my future? I am not a prize to be won.
Sultan: Oh, dear. Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just give Jasmine time to cool down.
Jafar: I think it's time to say good-bye to Prince Abooboo.
Prince Ali: [Aladdin sighs] What am I gonna do? Jasmine won't even let me talk to her. I should've known I couldn't pull off this stupid prince wish.
[growling]
Genie: So move. Hey. That's a good move. I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.
Prince Ali: Genie, I need help.
Genie: All right, Sparky, here's the deal. If you wanna court the little lady, you gotta be a straight shooter. Do you got it?
Aladdin: What?
Genie: Tell her the truth!
Aladdin: No way. If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me.
Genie: A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh. Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself.
Prince Ali: Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be. Okay, I'm gonna go see her. I just... I gotta be smooth, cool, confident. How do I look?
Genie: Like a prince.
[sighs]
Prince Ali: Princess Jasmine?
[growling]
Jasmine: Who's there?
Prince Ali: It's me, Prince Ali. Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.
Jasmine: I do not want to see you.
Prince Ali: No, no, please, Princess. Give me a chance.
Jasmine: Just leave me alone.
Prince Ali: Down, kitty.
Genie: So, how's your little beau doing?
Prince Ali: Good kitty, take off.
[Rajah growling]
Prince Ali: Down, kitty.
Jasmine: Wait. Wait. Do I know you?
Prince Ali: Uh, no. No.
Jasmine: You remind me of someone I met in the marketplace.
Prince Ali: The marketplace? I have servants who go to the marketplace for me. Why, I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants. So. I couldn't have been me you met.
Jasmine: No. I guess not.
Genie: Enough about you, Casanova. Talk about her. She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything. Pick a feature.
Prince Ali: Ahem. Uh, Princess Jasmine? You're very...
Genie: Wonderful, magnificent, punctual.
Prince Ali: ...punctual.
Jasmine: Punctual?
Genie: Sorry.

Genie: Okay, fine. But remember, "bee" yourself.

Jasmine: What?
