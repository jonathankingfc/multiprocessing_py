# multiprocessing_py
Multiprocessing in Python 3 through different workloads

Workloads:

The main benefit of multiprocessing is that it can take advantage of systems with multiple cores to speed up CPU-intensive programs. In our exploration of multiprocessing, we've selected several workloads that are particularly CPU-intensive. For easier comparison, we've divided them up into four categories - Web Scraping/Crawling, Mathematical Computations, Filo I/O, and General Computer Science Algorithms.

Web Scraping / Crawling: 

    Weather Scraping:
    
        PLACEHOLDER: Takes in a list of cities, and finds weather
    Web Spyder: 
    
        PLACEHOLDER: Goes through a fuckton of links
    Downloading Images:
    
Mathematical Computations:

    Matrix Multiplication:
    
    Finding Primes:
    
   
Filo I/O:

    File Compression:
    
    Read / Write
    
General Computer Science Algorithms:

    Sorting Algorithms:
