# multiprocessing_py
Multiprocessing in Python 3 through different workloads

## How to Use
The usage of this application is fairly simple. It is a simple CLI that takes user input in order to test through various workloads. The user can choose from various workloads and specify how many processes they would like to complete it on. The runtimes are they given. One is also able to make a graph of the test results. 


### Step 1
Use Conda to enter into a Python 3.6 environment. On the iLab, this can be done by the following command: 
`source activate python36`

### Step 2
Navigate to the directory of main.py in the multiprocessing_py folder. Once here, you will see a requirements.txt file.
Run the command: `conda install --file requirements.txt`

### Step 3
Once the dependencies have been installed, you are ready to run the application. This is done by running: `python main.py`

Enjoy!!!
